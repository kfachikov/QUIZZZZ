# OOPP Project Group 29

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## How to run it

- Download the repository-template and access it through the terminal or through GitKraken. 
- Then open it in an IDE such as Intellij IDEA or Visual Studio Code. 
- Then download the activity-bank as a zip file from Gitlab and extract its files. 
- Then run the server and after that run the client by entering "gradle run" in the terminal of the IDE. 
- Then using the admin panel, you should import the `activities.json` file from the activity-bank.

## How to contribute to it

 - Download the repository-template and access it through the terminal or through GitKraken.
 - Then open it in an IDE such as Intellij IDEA or Visual Studio Code. 
 - Then create a development branch so the changes you have made will not directly go into the actual project as a way to protect the integrity of the project.
 - Then create an issue in GitLab and also a corresponding merge request, make sure the merge request will merge into the development branch and then you can code away on the branch of the merge request. 
 - If you feel you have coded enough on a specific feature and there are no more errors and checkstyle errors, stage the changes you have made, give the push a nice title explaining what you have coded and push to the branch of the merge request.
 - If you have finished implementing the feature and there is enough testing on the feature, you can merge your merge request into development and the feature will also be present in the development branch. 
 - Then after a week of hard work on the project, you can merge the development branch into the main branch of the project after you have made sure that the development branch works completely fine and it is safe to merge to the main branch. 
 - When you have merged the development branch into the main branch, the features you have implemented will also be present in the actual project, more specifically in the main branch.
