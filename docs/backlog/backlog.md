# Backlog
## Must
- play a solo game

As a user, I should be able to play a solo game because that is one of the mandatory features of the game.

- play a multiplayer 

As a user, I should be able to play a multiplayer game, as that is one of the mandatory features of the game as well.

- including the waiting room

Users must be in a waiting room before starting the game, because otherwise a multiplayer game is not possible, because in order to have a multiplayer game, there must be more than one person who plays in a game, so to gather people for a multiplayer game a waiting room must be present, allowing more than one person to play in a game.

- client-server communication

Client-server communication must be present in order to have games be able to run, because otherwise that is not possible.

- power-ups (Joker cards)

As a user, I shall be capable of having three joker cards so that the game becomes more interesting, and for me as a player it would offer me an advantage. 

- leaderboard for the best-scoring players

As a user, I shall be able to see the leaderboard for the best-scoring players so that I can see who is performing the best among all the players and possibly if I am among those who are.

- infinitely big sessions

As a user, I shall be able to participate in infinitely big sessions so that I can play with as many people as I want.

- asking for username

As a user, I must be asked to enter a username so that I can be saved into the system.

- two players cannot share a username in one game

Two users must not share a username in one game because they would not be able to differentiate from each other, thus not knowing their real position or score.



## Should:
- images

As a user, I should see an image together with the question text, as that would help me comprehend the question faster.

- giving points considering the speed

As a user, I should be awarded more points if I answer correctly faster than some other players, because thus some “hierarchy” can be established.

- timing the questions

As a user, I should see the time remaining to answer the current question, as otherwise, I wouldn’t know when it’s up, and thus, I might not answer in time, thinking there is some more time.

- intermediate leaderboard

As a user, I should be able to see an intermediate leaderboard, as I would like to see how I am doing in comparison to the other players.

As a user, I should see the current leaderboard several times during a multiplayer game, as otherwise I wouldn’t know how I am doing and there would be no motivation to “try to beat the others” - the competitive aspect will somehow be lacking.

- estimation questions

Realized a user doesn’t have a reason to “require” estimation questions?

## Could:
- emoji

As a user, I could make use of some emoji reactions because that would make the game more interactive and fun.

- using more than one joker per question

As a user, I could use more than one joker per question as it would make the game more challenging for the other players and give me a solid advantage.

- display positioning during game

As a user, I could make use of knowing my position on the leaderboard, because it would motivate me to improve my score.

- possible to change your answer

As a user, I could make use of changing my answer to a question as I could change my mind about the right answer to a question.


- pop-ups and songs

As a user, I could appreciate it if the game I’m playing could have a catchy background song and attractive design aspects as they would make the game more remarkable and fun to play.

- swapping the "remove answer" card into something else(range-provider) for estimation questions

As a user, if I still have my “remove answer” card, and if the question is an estimation question, I would appreciate it if I could use this card as a hint that gives a range the correct answer is in because I still want to be able to use my Joker in every question. 

## Won't:
- chat

As a user, I don’t want to have a chat during the game so that the players are not distracted.

- private rooms

As a user, I do not need to have an option to create private rooms since there won’t be a lot of independent players trying to play at the same time. 

- kicking

As a user, I do not need to have a right to kick someone from the waiting room since there (most of the time) won’t be a player we don’t wish to play with, and a player that stays idle cannot damage our game flow.  

- authentication

As a user, I do not need to authenticate myself in a specific way except by inputting my username since that will be enough to identify myself in a global leaderboard, AND my username is specific to me in a multiplayer lobby.
