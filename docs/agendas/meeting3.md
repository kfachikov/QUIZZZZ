## Meeting Schedule

### [13:45 - 13:50] Check-in

- Is everyone present?

### [13:50 - 14:00] Summary of last week

- How are things going? What did everyone do in the previous week? Did they manage to complete their tasks (in time)?
- What is left in progress?
- Has everyone done the Information Literacy Module? — hard deadline is the upcoming Friday, so make sure you do it in time.

### [14:00 - 14:15] Action points for next week

- Set up a common auto-formatting setting in IntelliJ. **Should be done before we start coding!**
- Fix the issues — remove the ones that do not fit the official ones and add the ones that we are missing.
- Split the workload of the first milestone among the team members.
- Prepare **at least one** question related to teamwork. It could be related to teamwork skills, teamwork “theory” (e.g. Belbin roles, Code of Conduct, etc.), or team experience.
- Information Literacy Module for the ones who haven’t done it yet.

### [14:15 - 14:35] Questions to the TA

- Feedback from the TA
    - Code of Conduct
    - Backlog
    - API endpoints -- advice on how to study them
    - Any good GitLab practices
- Everyone has the opportunity to ask out supervisor (the TA) for suggestions about points we haven’t mentioned during the meeting yet, or things that are still unclear.
    - How should we proceed with the project from now on? What to with the issues? Should we create new ones according to the “official” backlog? Should we restructure the management accomplished within our project — issues, milestones, etc...
    Or rather, we should simply begin working?
- Ask for overall feedback. How we are doing? Any advice to improve?

### [14:35 - 14:45] Tip & Top

- Everyone has around 2 minutes to give personal **constructive** advice, or praise, as well as to give some general suggestions about the team workflow and comment on what he finds great within the current environment.

### [14:45] Closing

- Choose the next chairperson and notetakers.

# Agenda Items

## Check-in

Approx. 13:45
Kayra attended online through Discord with video and audio. The rest of us were all on time and attended physically.


We shared opinions about the project
- Julius: We do not have the most productive schedule at times.
- Monica: Likes how we work, wants tasks more assigned to one singleUser and all of us to have the same amount of work.
- Kayra: We worked well and the meeting flow was good, but sometimes our meetings went overtime which we have improved on.
- Alexandra: We should divide the work better, we work well.
- Marijn: We are good on track, our meetings went overtime, but now it is going better. 

##  Summary of last week

Approx. 14:00
 - We did the 2A assignment, the 2B assignment which included the Code of Conduct, we did the backlog and we started on the HCI assignment.


## Action points for next week
Approx. 14:05

- Have the same coding settings in Intellij.
- Decide on how we split the work among ourselves.
- Come up with the questions for the assignment until the next meeting - Tuesday**.
- Change tasks for the issues(optional).
- Conclude the HCI report -  Friday**.
- Everyone should learn about the API. 
- Try to do at least 2 responds - Friday**.

## Questions to the TA
Approx. 14:15
 
    - Feedback on the Code of Conduct: 
        - We should add more rules until Friday
        - the grade is achievable, but not realistic
        - Assignment part → they want us to relate the answers more towards the final product
        - Gitlab repository at the end should contain all the agenda
        - Decide on how we proceed to add and cancel meetings
        - It is not necessary that we give Florina reports about what we are doing throughout the week, but it would be easier for her    
        to give us individual assignments.
    - Julius : What are the deadlines of all the upcoming assignments and other things we need to do? 
    → I shall ask this to the lecturers as there is still quite a bit unclear about that.
    - Julius : Should we keep you constantly updated about our progress or just give you a summary? 
    → I would prefer it if you would, because it was a bit unclear for me last week 
    where you were exactly regarding the assignments, so yes it would be nice if you tell me where you are regularly.
    - Kaloyan : Should we change the issues? 
    → No, it is too early to modify them. Wait for all the feedback and then you can change them.
    - Julius : Get and Post are clear, but what do we use Put and Delete for? 
    It doesn’t really fit in the game we are trying to make 
    → Put is to add information, not to edit it. You also don’t need all 4 things in your final project, you just need it for the upcoming assignment.
    - Kaloyan : Should the issues be precise about what we have to do? 
    → Yes, they are a guide for the project, but you don’t need to modify them now.


## Tip & Top

- Kaloyan:
    - a tip towards Julius -- make sure you check your social medias a bit more frequently, as sometimes it's hard to reach you
    - top to everyone -- love the way we organized the app design process; everyone came prepared to the meeting, full of ideas to share
    - top to Kayra -- handled our first small fight (over weights in GitLab with Julius) with calmness, giving yourself time to understand the others' opinion
- Monica:
    - top to everyone -- enjoys the fact we are organized
    - tip to everyone -- when assigning task, be more specific and assign them more individually -- this would prevent the long "unnecessary" discussions over insignificant details
- Kayra:
    - top to Kaloyan -- like the agenda -- it was specific and helped me prepare for the meeting
    - *comment* -- this week is better; fond of the individual deadlines


## Closing

Next meeting.
- Chairperson: Monica
- Notetakers: Julius and Kaloyan
