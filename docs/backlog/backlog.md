# Backlog
## Must
- solo gameplay button

As a user, I shall be presented with a "Solo Game" button when I enter the game, as I would like to play on my own to test my knowledge.

- multiplayer gameplay button

As a user, I shall be presented a "Multiplayer" when I enter the game, as I would like to be able to compete against other people.

- "Choose the right activity"-type question

As a user, I shall be asked to choose among several (3) activities which is the one with the lowest/highest consumption, as that would make me aware of how energy-inefficient are many of the daily activities.
- different question each round

As a user, I shall be asked different questions in each round, as otherwise there would be no point in answering the same ones over and over again.

- several options as answers for multiple-choice questions

As a user, I shall be presented a several (preferably 3) choices for a correct answer, so that I can make a fast guess in this "speed game".

- synchronous questions

As a user, the currently asked question should be presented to me exactly when it becomes visible for the other users, as otherwise the game wouldn't be up-to-date and some players might cheat.

- queue

As a user, I shall be able to enter a queue instead of being directly connected to a game, as thus, I would have the opportunity to wait for my friends (be waited for by them) or wait for more people to join so that the game is more interesting.

- start button is available while waiting in the queue

As a user, once already in the queue, I shall be able to begin the game whenever I want, as that would allow my friends and me to play in something like a "private" room.

- client-server communication

As a user, I shall have my answers checked, as otherwise, I would be able to know whether I'm guessing it right or not.

- power-ups (Joker cards)

As a user, I shall be capable of having some joker cards, as that would make the game more interesting.

- using a joker card on different questions

As a user, I shall be able to use my remaining jokers to give myself some advantage over the other players.

- leaderboard for the best-scoring players

As a user, I shall be able to see the leaderboard for the best-scoring players so that I can see who is performing the best among all the players and possibly if I am among those who are.

- infinitely big sessions

As a user, I shall be able to participate in infinitely big sessions, so that I can play with as many people as I want.

- assigning a username to each player in solo mode

As a user, I shall have a username, so that I can recognize myself among all players in the solo player leaderboard.

- assigning a username to each player in multiplayer mode

As a user, I shall have a username, so that I can recognize myself and distinguish among my opponents.

- two players cannot share a username in one game

As a user, I shall have a unique username in a multiplayer environment, as otherwise, it would be impossible to tell apart two players with identical usernames.

- short timing for answering the questions

As a user, I shall have just a few seconds to answer the question, as this is supposed to game of both knowledge and speed.

- 20 different activities stored in the database

As a user, I shall be asked questions about different activities' consumption rates, as that would improve the game drastically in terms of interest and curiosity among the players.

- ranking/leaderboard presented at the end of each multiplayer game

As a user, I shall be able to see how my opponents have scored in total after a game, and also, how I placed among them so that I can stay motivated to learn and to re-match them to do better (or to defend the first place if already on top).
# Should:

- images

As a user, I should see an image together with the question text, as that would help me comprehend the question faster.

- giving points considering the speed

As a user, I should be awarded more points if I answer correctly faster than some other players, because thus some “hierarchy” can be established.

- the speed is "deduced" by how many seconds are left so that the "reduce time" gives more advantage

As a user, I should be able to negatively affect the others by using my "reduce time" power-up, so it would be reasonable to consider the speed of an answer depending on the time left for that specific user.
- timing the questions

As a user, I should see the time remaining to answer the current question, as otherwise, I wouldn’t know when it’s up, and thus, I might not answer in time, thinking there is some more time.

- intermediate leaderboard

As a user, I should be able to see an intermediate leaderboard during multiplayer games, as I would like to see how I am doing in comparison to the other players.

- a different type of questions

As a user, I should be asked differently phrased questions, as otherwise the game would be pretty monotonous and would easily bore me.

- estimation questions

As a user, I should be asked a question that requires me to estimate a specific value (e.g. power consumption of a certain appliance) at least once, as that would make the game more exciting and intriguing.

- using power-ups after answering a question

As a user, I should be able to use a "wild-card" even after answering a question, as this is a game of speed and I would strive to answer as fast as I can at first.

- back option after a game is done

As a user, I should be presented with a "Return Home" option after a game is finished, as that would improve the usability a lot.

- disconnecting

As a user, I should see some indication that a player is inactive (disconnected) so that I know how many active players are still in the game.
## Could:

- emoji

As a user, I could make use of some emoji reactions, as that would allow me to express myself and to see how the other players "engage".

- see other people's emojis

As a user, I could see how other people are reacting to the current questions, as that would make the game much more fun to play

- using more than one joker per question

As a user, I could use more than one joker per question, as it would make the game more challenging for the other players and give me a solid advantage.

- display positioning during game

As a user, I could make use of knowing my position on the leaderboard, as it would motivate me to improve my score.

- possible to change your answer

As a user, I could make use of changing my answer to a question, as I could change my mind about the right answer to a question.

- pop-ups and songs

As a user, I could appreciate if the game I’m playing could have a catchy background song and attractive design aspects, as they would make the game more remarkable and fun to play.

- swapping the "remove answer" card into something else (e.g. range-provider) for estimation questions

As a user, if I still have my “remove answer” card, and if the question is an estimation question, I would appreciate it if I could use this card as a hint that gives me some advantage, as I would like to be able to use my Joker in all of the questions.

- immediately join the queue after a multiplayer game

As a user, I could be able to rejoin the queue - to "begin" a new game just after the current one ends, as that would make it a lot easier for me to play multiple games.

- hints revealing how points are calculated next to the current question

As a user, I could be presented with an option to check how points are calculated on every question so that I have some basic understanding of the game and probably develop some in-game strategies.

- displaying an "alert" when someone has left

As a user, I could be alerted if any of my opponents have left, so that I know against how many people I compete with.

## Won't:
- chat

As a user, I don’t want to have a chat during the game so that the players are not distracted.

- private rooms

As a user, I do not need to have an option to create private rooms since there won’t be a lot of independent players trying to play at the same time.

- kicking

As a user, I do not need to have a right to kick someone from the waiting room since there (most of the time) won’t be a player we don’t wish to play with, and a player that stays idle cannot damage our game flow.

- authentication

As a user, I do not need to authenticate myself in a specific way except by inputting my username since that will be enough to identify myself in a global leaderboard, AND my username is specific to me in a multiplayer lobby.
