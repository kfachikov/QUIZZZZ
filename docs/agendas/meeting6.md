  - Take days to finish it—nicely, with no bugs.
  - Make sure to stop assigning issues to multiple members
  - Change/ensure that

    - Since Monica and Alexandra only had group issues, whereas others had both
  - Keep track of the time spent under merge requests
  - Make sure Marijn is closer to rest of the team
    - Give Marijn another issue *(additional)*
  - We are past the GitInspector discussion
  - Give nice titles in commits

- Code style is good
  - Merge Requests and feature branches are also good
    - Monica and Kayra didn't have
  - Code reviews are good
  
- Currently testing is not great
  - The members' work rate was not constant during the last sprint
  - Issue creation was not intended for a single person (not desired)
        - *(multiple issues have multiple people)*
  - Task distribution was a little underwhelming

## Tip & Top

Kaloyan
- top: [EVERYONE] Let others help / edit your commit (consensual)
- tip: [EVERYONE] Use time spent

Kayra

- tip: For Marijn -> talk more in the MRs, comment more and update us on your latest MRs

Alexandra

- top: I think that we are working as a real team now and I like that the conflicts about gitinspector are done. I don't know exactly what generated this huge difference, but the atmosphere is for sure a desirable one.
- tip: Since at the end of this week we should all be almost equal in the code contribution, we should probably invest less time in the issue splitting process ( not in the sprint creation ).

Monica

- top: The new rules regarding the merge requests are taken into consideration and this fact improved our work.
- tip: We should all be more careful when implementing something having in mind that our code have to be integrated in the final version, but Florena already said that.

Julius
- top for Alexandra: a week ago you worked hard on the issue distribution; before the meeting you compiled a list of issues. I appreciate the stepping up of that
- tip for Kaloyan: focus on the project but also focus on the fact that half of the project is teamwork
- tip to Marijn : sell your merge requests. I mean at the moment you see the description you should want to click approve.

Marijn

- top: [EVERYONE] Liked the meeting on Sunday:
  - created issues before and assigned really quickly

## Closing
- Choose the next chairperson and notetakers.
  - Chairperson — Julius
  - Notetakers —  Kaloyan and Kayra
